# Automated Segmentation of Peripheral Arteries in 3D CT Data Based on a Single-Depth Vascular Network

## WORK IN PROGRESS
## Introduction
This repository contains source code for the automated segmentation of peripheral arteries from 3D CT scans using a Single-Depth Vascular Network (SDVN). The pipeline allows preprocessing, training, and evaluation of segmentation models for medical imaging research.

## Pipeline
The pipeline performs:
- Preprocessing of CT scans (normalization, resampling, ROI extraction)
- Training of the SDVN model
- Model evaluation and inference on test CT scans

## Requirements
- PyTorch
- SimpleITK
- NumPy, SciPy
